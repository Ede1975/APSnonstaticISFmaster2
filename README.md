#nonStaticISF version

- Build on AAPS master

- Changes to default behaviour:
profile ISF will be used as ISF@BG 100
in the SMB Tab ISF@200 has to be defined
also define max and min ISF allowed for safety reasons
a formula will be used to calculate the current ISF:
ISF=m/bg+a

where m and a will be calculated from the ISFs defined at BG100 (from profile) and BG200.
This way the curve will vary over the day a bit if different ISF values are defined areounf the clock in profile
ISF@200 does not change.

I am not a professional programmer, this has to be used as a dev version!
Nevertheless i use this version for my son with good results so far

Reason to build this version was that unfortunately the dynamic ISF approach from TimS and ChrisW is not working well for my son an i wanted more control back and some kind of circadian behaviour back in ISF values
